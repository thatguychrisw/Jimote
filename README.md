## How to run
    - To run / build on OSX you will need xcode installed via the app store
      - Note: You may need to accept the xcode license agreement via `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`
      - Note: If the above command does not work you may need to execute `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` instead
    - Run `npm install`
    - Run `electron-forge start`
    - Cmd+j opens app
    - Esc hides app when app has focus
    - Cmd+q quits app when app has focus
